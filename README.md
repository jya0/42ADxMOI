# 42ADxMOI

&emsp;> This is a joint hackathon by 42 Abu Dhabi and the Ministry of Interior UAE.
</br>
&emsp;> 42ADxMOI aims to better UX in an all-inclusive way (i.e. for People of Determination) through gamification.
</br>
&emsp;> We entered as "Team Kudos", which consisted Mukhammadusmon Ganiev, Faraz Khan and I (Jinxiu Yao).


## Description

#### Problems Identified:
* __There needs to be a better user experience on the website, so users won't feel compelled to call the support centre.__
* __There needs to be more accessibility support to the People of Determination to ensure the user experience is all-inclusive.__
#### Solutions Suggested:
* _A suite of gamified features using 'Kudos' points and an intelligent realtime AI to help users._
* _A menu dedicated for People of Determination which allow single tap buttons to dial for help._
